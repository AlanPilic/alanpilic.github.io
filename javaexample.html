                <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
                <p>
                    Java is an object-oriented language, statically strong-typed programming language. Java is primarily used in somewhere of
                    the vicinity of 3 billion applications. Quite the number, Java's uses grow every day and is the first
                    language of many modern software engineers. The purpose of this page is to showcase small snippets of
                    fun programs I created, showcasing some of the features of the language. The page will focus less on
                    HTML/CSS and more on java code, with that said the code you can follow along by using a Integrated Development
                    Environment of your choice, my personal preference being Eclipse.
                </p>

                <h3>It always starts with a system output call</h3>
                <pre>
package examples;

public class basic {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("Hi there! Welcome to my Java Page");

    }

}
                    </pre>
                <p>This basic command in Java prints whatever contents are inside out to our screen. The basic idea behind the
                    function is whatever is called within the quotations will be output to the screen via the compiler.
                </p>
                <pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {

    String _aGreeting = "Hi there! Welcome to my Java Page";

    System.out.println(_aGreeting);

}
                    </pre>
                <p>This is also another way of getting the same result as the example above. The reason behind this is that
                    Java is an object oriented language, therefore it allows you to utilize many classes and objects within
                    it's library to be more productive, think of frameworks in JavaScript. For further reading I suggest
                    taking a look at the Java documentation as it does an amazing job at explaining the language in detail.

                <h3>Guessing game but with strings, showcases simple loops, arrays, conditionals, very common syntax amongst

                </h3>

                <p>A very simple game that showcases the syntax for Java to guess the correct mythos within an array</p>

        int trys = 3;
        
        while(trys!= 0) {		
            
            System.out.println("Take a guess at what mythos character I am");

                trys--;

            }
            
            // Gives the user a last chance by looking at the last character of the array
            if(trys == 1) {
                System.out.println("Alright, I'll give you another hint the last character is " + _mythologyArray[n].charAt(_mythologyArray[n].length() - 1))  ;
            }
            
        }

        quit = input.nextLine();
    
    }
    
}
                </pre>

                <h3> Let's jump into Object Oriented Programing, objects are like real life objects, objects have characteristics
                    that define them and serve as blueprints</h3>

                <p>In this example I've created an object called Animal. The object holds attributes such as the amount of leg's
                    it has and whether it has a trunk or tail and a private variable only accessible through methods to retain
                    variable integrity</p>

                <pre>
public class animal {

    String name = "";
    int legs = 2;
    int arms = 2;
    int runningSpeed = 3;
    String tail = "yes";
    String claws = "yes";
    String trunk = "no";

    private int weight = 0;
    
    // constructor
    public animal(int _legs, int _arms, int _runningSpeed, String _tail, String _claws, String _trunk) {
        this.legs = _legs;
        this.arms= _arms;
        this.runningSpeed = _runningSpeed;
        this.tail = _tail;
        this.claws = _claws;
        this.trunk = _trunk;
    }
    
    public animal(String _name) {
        this.name = _name;
    }
    
    // methods that change private fields
    void changeWeight(int _weight) {
        this.weight = _weight;
    }
    
    void changeMySpeed(int _speed) {
        this.runningSpeed = _speed;
    }
    
    void printAttributes() {
        System.out.println("My animal's name is " + name + ", it has " + legs + " legs, " + 
                arms + " arms, it runs at the speed of " + runningSpeed + 
                " mph, it has a private weight of " + weight + " lbs. ");
        System.out.println(tail + " to having a tail, " + claws + " to having claws, and lastly "
                + trunk + " to having a trunk.");
    }
    

}
                </pre>

                <p> We call this class by creating an instance of the animal class by instantiating the class in the main class
                    :</p>

                <pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {
    animal tiger = new animal(2, 2, 30, "Yes", "Yes", "No");
    tiger.name = "Tiger";
    tiger.changeWeight(800);
    tiger.printAttributes();
    
    animal bear = new animal(2, 2, 20, "Yes", "Yes", "No");
    bear.name = "Bear";
    bear.changeWeight(1200);
    bear.printAttributes();
    
    animal elephant = new animal(2, 2, 15, "Yes", "Yes", "Yes");
    elephant.name = "Elephant";
    elephant.changeWeight(1500);
    elephant.printAttributes();
}
                </pre>

                <p>By creating copies of the animal without having to constantly recreate the same blueprint (animal object) over and over with
                    the same redudant code, one can see why the object oriented language is so useful</p>

                <h3> Moving onto data structures, the bread and butter for most middleware languages. I'll start with a simple example of Array Lists</h3>

                <p>This is a simple example of a declration of an Array-List. An Array-List is practically the same data structure as an array but it doesn't require initial space declaration.</p>

                <pre>
ArrayList<String> arrayListOfStrings = new ArrayList<String>();

    arrayListOfStrings.add("Hello");
    arrayListOfStrings.add("I am");
    arrayListOfStrings.add("An Array List");
    arrayListOfStrings.add("of Strings");

System.out.println(arrayListOfStrings);
                </pre>

                <p>The output for this will yield : </p>

                <pre>
[Hello, I am, An Array List, of Strings]
                </pre>

                <p>Now let's add a bit more complexity to this by adding in our animal objects into an array list of animals</p>

                <pre>
animal tiger = new animal(2, 2, 30, "Yes", "Yes", "No");
tiger.name = "Tiger";
tiger.changeWeight(800);

animal lion = new animal(2, 2, 25, "Yes", "Yes", "No");
lion.name = "Lion";
lion.changeWeight(900);

animal cat = new animal(2, 2, 18, "Yes", "Yes", "No");
cat.name = "Cat";
cat.changeWeight(10);

ArrayList<span><<span><span>animal></span> aListOfCats = new ArrayList<span><<span><span>animal></span>();

aListOfCats.add(tiger);
aListOfCats.add(lion);
aListOfCats.add(cat);
                </pre>

                <p>If we go ahead and print this now Java will give us the name of the class and the memory reference to this object. The most common method to print out 
                    the contents of the object is to override the toString method to print out the contents of our object but that is a topic for another time.
                </p>

                <h3>Let's go over some HashMaps as they are also a very frequently used data structure</h3>

                <p>Hash Maps are useful if you need to use a key value pairing of sorts in a data structure, a practical example of this would be a dictionary. Now let's take a looking 
                    at a implementation of a Hash Map.
                </p>

                <pre>
HashMap<span><</span>Integer, ArrayList> aKingdom = new HashMap<span><</span>Integer, ArrayList>();

        aKingdom.put(0, aListOfCats);
        aKingdom.put(1, aListOfBears);
        aKingdom.put(2, aListOfElephants);
        Set<span><</span>Integer> keys = aKingdom.keySet();
        
        for(Integer key: keys) {
            
            for(int i = 0 ; i < aKingdom.get(key).size(); i++) {
                System.out.println(key + " is = " + aKingdom.get(key).get(i).toString());
            }
            
        }
                </pre>

                <p>For this example I created additional Array Lists from our previous example and added them accordingly to our HashMap called aKingdom, which is a reference to 
                    an animal kingdom. Each list of animals has a corresponding integer, 0 being the list of cats, 1 being a list of bears, 2 being a list of elephants. HashMaps differ a bit
                in syntax as they have what is called Keys, therefore we call the Set keys structure to extrapulate the specific key from the map and print it out via the for loop.</p>
